            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:14359:111"/>to doe: that is, to reſolue them ſelues ſo all kinde of carnall licence and ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, running and folowing without bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, whether ſo euer theyr licence giuen doth giue them leaue (as therefore not without cauſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prouerbe doth reporte of them) that kings ſonnes learn nothing elſe well but only to ride. Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby that Princes and Kings ſonnes hauing aboute them flatterers, which boaſt them in theyr faultes: only theyr horſſes giue them no more than to any other, but if they fit not faſt, they will caſt them. But this yong king ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him ſelfe the inclination of the fleſhe, minding not to giue him ſelfe ſo muche as he might take, but rather by reſiſtance to auoid the temptation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, beſought God that he would ſend to him ſome continuall ſickneſſe in quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of that vice, whereby he mighte be more profitable to the buſineſſe of the common wealth, and more apte to ſerue God in his calling. Then at Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce he had the euill called <hi>Bicus,</hi> till he came to the age of twentie yeres. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſickneſſe being cured, he fel to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,

Alſo he deuided his goods into two equall partes, the one appertaining to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſeculare, the other to vſes ſpirituall or eccleſiaſtical. Of the which two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall partes, the firſte he deuided into thrée portions: the firſt to the behooſe of his houſe and familie: the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon his workemenne and builders of his newe woorkes, whereof he had right great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighte and cunning: the thirde vppon ſtraungers. Likewiſe the other ſeconde halfe vppon ſpirituall vſes, he did thus deuide in foure portions, one to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuing of the poore, an other to monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the third to the ſchollers of Oxford, for maintina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of good letters, the fourth he ſent to forren churches wythoute the realme. Alſo ſo ſparing he was of time, that he deuided the day and the night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three partes, if he were not lette by
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14359:112"/>warres and other great buſineſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viij. houres he ſpent in ſtudy and learning, &amp; other. viij houres he ſpent in prayer and almes déedes, and other. viij. houres he ſpent his naturall reſt, ſuſtinance of his body, and the néedes of the realme. The which order he kept duely by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burning of waxen tapers, kept in his cloſette by certaine perſones for the ſame purpoſe. Nowe beſides theſe other qualities and gifts of Gods grace in him, aboue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: remaineth another part of his no little praiſe &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, which is his learning and knowledge of good letters, whereof not only he was excellent expert himſelf, but alſo a worthy maintainer of the ſame throughout all his dominions. He tranſlated into Engliſh <hi>Oroſſius, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorale Gregorij</hi> the hiſtorie of <hi>Bede, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etius de conſolatione Philoſophie,</hi> alſo a Booke of his owne making in his owne tong, which in the Engliſhe ſpéeche is called a handbooke, in Gréeke called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiridion, in Latin a manuell.

            <p>The ſame day that <hi>Socrate,</hi> ſhoulde drincke his deadly drench, when his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles were taken off his feete, he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe maruellous light and pleaſant, and ſayde: behold how wonderouſly nature hath ordeyned,<note place="margin">Lycoſthe.</note> that ſorowe and pleaſure goe alwayes togither, and that there is neuer any perfite pleaſure, where there hath not bene paine and ſorowe before. <hi>Ex Laertio, lib. 2.</hi>

The third, a minde im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing (lightly) the worſt opinion, and barren of diſcretion to make true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt good &amp; bad, betwixt trouth and vanity. The fourth, a proud diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of other good men, in all honeſt maters. <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Home.</hi> haue both one meaning.

The fourth frute of vain plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Platoes</hi> iudgement is pride of them ſelues, and contempt of all others, which is the very badge of all thoſe that ſerue in <hi>Circes</hi> Courte, who tranſformeth the voluptuous man (as hath bene deſcribed) into a maruellous monſter, which caryeth at once in one body, the belly of a ſwine, the head of an aſſe, the heart of a horſſe, the braine of a fore, and the wombe of a wolfe. <hi>Ex lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimagiſtro domini Aſchami Platonis E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtola. 3. ad Dionyſium.</hi>

            <p>WE reade of many prophane Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers (as <hi>Socrates, Diogenes, Bion, Crates, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras,</hi> and innumerable others) who conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that worldly wealth could nothing leſſe doo, than cauſe a quiet minde, as a thing of no worthineſſe, neglected it, and as a thyng of no pryce, ſette it at nought.</p>
